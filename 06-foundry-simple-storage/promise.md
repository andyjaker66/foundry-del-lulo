I promise to never use my private key associated with real money in plain text.

1. For the moment, a `$PRIVATE_KEY` in my `.env` is cool.
   1. So long as I don't expose the `.env` file.
2. But for real money, I won't do that. I will use `--interactive` or a keystore file with password once foundry adds that.
